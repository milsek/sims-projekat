INSERT INTO EDITION VALUES('Will your organization be protected the day a quantum computer breaks encryption on the internet? Computer encryption is vital for protecting users, data, and infrastructure in the digital age. Using traditional computing, even common desktop encryption could take decades for specialized ‘crackers’ to break and government and infrastructure-grade encryption would take billions of times longer. In light of these facts, it may seem that today’s computer cryptography is a rock-solid way to safeguard everything from online passwords to the backbone of the entire internet. Unfortunately, many current cryptographic methods will soon be obsolete. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) predicted that quantum computers will soon be able to break the most popular forms of public key cryptography.

The colonial police force in the Dutch East Indies was reformed in the early 1920s, and banditry was subsequently brought under control. However, the bandit tradition lived on in Javanese popular imagination and folk culture, not least in tales of Si Pitung, a Robin Hood figure who flourished in nineteenth-century Batavia.

The introduction of the guitar, at first not a solo instrument, really demonstrated rhythmic ingenuity. Sallis shows how folk music and a cross-fertilization of traditions and techniques resulted in blues, ragtime, jazz, rock ''n'' roll, and country-western. He writes eloquently about fourteen transitional or pivotal performers: the Mississippi Sheiks; Lonnie Johnson, the first virtuoso blues guitarist; Eddie Lang, the first great jazz guitarist; Roy Smeck, the foremost popularizer of guitar playing; Charlie Christian, the founder of modern jazz guitar; Riley Puckett, the first great country-music guitarist; T-Bone Walker, "daddy of the blues"; George Barnes; Hank Garland; We', '22', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LgXaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&source=gbs_api', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LgXaAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'en', 288, 2.4, 122, true, PARSEDATETIME('1994', 'yyyy'), 160, 224, 59);
