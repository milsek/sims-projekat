Unfortunately, the reality is that the improved hardware hasn''t kept pace with the ever-increasing quantity of data processed today. Although disk packing densities have increased enormously, making storage costs extremely low and sequential read very fast, random reads are still painfully slow. Many of the old design recommendations are therefore no longer valid-the optimal point of indexing has come a long way. Consequently many of the old problems haven''t actually gone away-they have simply changed their appearance. This book provides an easy but effective approach to the design of indexes and tables.
