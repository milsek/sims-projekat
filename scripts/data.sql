The award-winning author Melanie Mitchell, a leading computer scientist, now reveals AI’s turbulent history and the recent spate of apparent successes, grand hopes, and emerging fears surrounding it.<br><br>In <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>, Mitchell turns to the most urgent questions concerning AI today: How intelligent—really—are the best AI programs? How do they work? What can they actually do, and when do they fail? How humanlike do we expect them to become, and how soon do we need to worry about them surpassing us? Along the way, she introduces the dominant models of modern AI and machine learning, describing cutting-edge AI programs, their human inventors, and t', '18', 'http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781250758040-L.jpg', 'http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781250758040-M.jpg', 'en', 336, 3.2, 220, true, PARSEDATETIME('2020', 'yyyy'), 39, 94);

You''ll also get details on database security, online analytical processing (OLAP), connecting databases to applications, and integrating XML and object content into databases.</p> <p>Designed for Easy Learning</p> <ul><li>Key Skills & Concepts--Chapter-opening lists of specific skills covered in the chapter </li> <li>Ask the Expert--Q&A sections filled with bonus information and helpful tips </', '20', 'http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780071608473-L.jpg', 'http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780071608473-M.jpg', 'en', 408, 2.0, 139, true, PARSEDATETIME('2009', 'yyyy'), 53, 146);
